# utPins 0.2.0

* Strip out server names, business logic and other private content from {utPins}

# utPins 0.1.3

* Renamed the subgroup for the faculty-workload pinnables to match the format used in the
  'subgroup' for the other pinnables ("faculty workload" rather than "faculty_workload").

# utPins 0.1.2

* Fix: ensure data-prep functions are called correctly from the data-steward and audit-report
  pinnables.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
